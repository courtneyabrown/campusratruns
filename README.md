University of Strathclyde CS408 Individual Project 2020/21

Finding university rooms can be tricky. They may be numbered but this doesn’t really tell you where they are. A second problem is finding the optimal route from one part of the campus to another which may involve cutting through buildings. A third problem is that the route might vary according to the weather – for instance in wet weather you may wish to stay undercover for as much of the route as possible, even if it takes a few minutes longer.
This app-based solution aims to support students with navigating their way around the University of Strathclyde campus, making sure to address the above identified issues associated with campus navigation.

How to run Campus Rat Runs application
1. Establish an Android device to run the application on. This can be an Android mobile or tablet device or alternatively via an Android emulator on a computer. Information on how to run apps on the Android Emulator via Android Studio can be found here: https://developer.android.com/studio/run/emulator

2. The Android Package File (APK) provided within the project: courtney_brown_fourth_year_project/CampusRatRuns/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk must be loaded onto the mobile or tablet device to run the application. Alternatively, if using an Android Emulator in Android Studio, the complete project must be loaded into Android Studio and run this way.

3. Upon success of the above, the application should load up on the Android device and is ready to be used.
